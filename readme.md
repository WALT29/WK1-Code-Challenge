By WALTER DAVID IRUNGU

## DESCRIPTION

This repository contains three different projects :
    1.Student Grade Genarator
    2.Speed Detector
    3.Net Salary Calculator

## TECHNOLOGIES USED

    1.HTML
    2.JAVASCRIPT
    3.GIT and GITHUB

## 1.Student Grade Generator (Toy Problem)

Write a function that prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. The output should correspond the correct grade, as shown below: 
 A > 79, B - 60 to 79, C -  59 to 49, D - 40 to 49, E - less 40.

### APPROACH
1.From the project,I am required to have a function 
2.The function must prompt the student to enter his/her marks which should be between 0-100
3.Since I am going use the marks entered by the student to grade him .I must store the entered marks in a variable.
4.Once I have stored the entered marks in a variable I must convert the marks to a Number .
5.The next step is to check the validity of the marks entered whereby the marks should lie between 0-100 and must be a valid number.If the marks entered are valid the marks will be evaluated,if the marks are not valid ,the student will be requested to enter valid marks which lie between 0-100
6.Once the marks entered are valid .I should determine the grade of the students based on Marks.
7.To determine the grade I have used conditonal statements .The conditional statements I have used is if (){}else if (){} ,this is because the problem requires us to evaluate multiple conditions.
8.The output is displayed on the console or the document using the alert function
